# Claude Code Session - August 20, 2025

## Task Summary
Remove Xing, Blue Sky, and LinkedIn social media accounts from the website while preserving the sharing buttons for these platforms.

## Progress

### Analysis Phase
- Explored codebase to understand social media configuration
- Found social accounts configured in `src/constants.ts` and `src/consts.ts`
- Identified that sharing buttons are separate from profile social links
- Discovered no Xing account was configured (only BlueSky and LinkedIn needed removal)

### Implementation
- **Removed from social media accounts** (profile/sidebar):
  - BlueSky profile link (`https://bsky.app/profile/steipete.me`)
  - LinkedIn profile link (`https://www.linkedin.com/in/steipete/`)
  
- **Preserved in sharing buttons** (for post sharing):
  - BlueSky sharing functionality
  - LinkedIn sharing functionality
  - All other sharing platforms remain intact

### Files Modified
1. `src/constants.ts` - Removed BlueSky and LinkedIn entries from SOCIALS array
2. `src/consts.ts` - Removed BlueSky from SOCIAL_LINKS array and ICON_MAP
3. `src/components/Socials.astro` - Cleaned up unused icon imports and mappings

### Testing
- Ran `npm run build` successfully
- No build errors or warnings
- All functionality preserved for sharing buttons

## Outcome
âœ… Task completed successfully - Social media accounts removed while sharing functionality preserved
