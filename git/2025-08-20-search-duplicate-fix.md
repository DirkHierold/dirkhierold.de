# Search Duplicate Results Fix - 2025-08-20

## Task Summary
Fix duplicate search results issue on the website search functionality.

## Progress
- [x] Investigate search implementation
- [x] Identify root cause of duplicates
- [x] Implement fix
- [x] Test and verify solution

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by duplicate route patterns generating the same blog post content at different URLs:
1. `/src/pages/posts/[...slug].astro` - generating year-prefixed paths like `/posts/2025/welcome-to-my-digital-journey/`
2. `/src/pages/posts/[...slug]/index.astro` - generating direct paths like `/posts/welcome-to-my-digital-journey/`

Both routes were indexing the same content, causing Pagefind to show duplicate search results.

## Solution
Removed the duplicate route file `/src/pages/posts/[...slug].astro` that was creating year-prefixed paths. The canonical route pattern using `/src/pages/posts/[...slug]/index.astro` was kept, which aligns with the canonical URL structure defined in `BlogPostLayout.astro`.

## Results
- Pagefind now indexes 1 page instead of 2 for the same content
- Search results no longer show duplicates
- Build process is cleaner with fewer generated routes
